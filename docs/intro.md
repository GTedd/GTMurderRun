## What is Murder Run?
If you are familiar with the game Dead by Daylight (DBD), you will be familiar with Murder Run. Murder Run is based off
the concept in DBD, an advanced game-mode revolving around two groups: killers and survivors. In a desolate map, survivors
must find all vehicle parts scattered everywhere and throw them back on the truck before the killers murder everyone or
the timer runs out.

over 100+ gadgets and abilities combined that the player can choose from. Each gadget and ability has many configuration 
options that you can configure to your own heart's desire.
