  EXCLUDED TRAPS FROM SSUNDEE'S SERIES
  Traps here are excluded for one of the following reasons:
  - Trap isn't explained well
  - Trap pertains to a specific theme too much (for example, Fortnite)
  - Trap functions too similar to another trap
  - Trap is not balanced or not worth implementing
  - Trap has controversial topics (for example, clickbait, demonetization, etc).
  - Trap was superseded by another trap (for example, paint trap -> infrared vision)

  Super Saiyan: Grants the Killer a significant speed and strength boost and giving them the ability to fly
  Fortnite Builder: Allows the Killer to generate, build, and place objects on the spot giving them an advantage.
  Infinity Gauntlet: Allows the Killer to jump extremely high and create explosions
