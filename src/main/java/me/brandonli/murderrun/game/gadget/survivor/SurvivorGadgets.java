  Traps here are excluded for one of the following reasons:
  - Trap isn't explained well
  - Trap pertains to a specific theme too much (for example, Fortnite)
  - Trap functions too similar to another trap
  - Trap is not balanced or not worth implementing
  - Trap has controversial topics (for example, clickbait, demonetization, etc).
  - Trap was superseded by another trap (for example, paint trap -> infrared vision)

  Jack-Jack - Laser Eyes -- shooting survivor makes them faster, murderer burns them
